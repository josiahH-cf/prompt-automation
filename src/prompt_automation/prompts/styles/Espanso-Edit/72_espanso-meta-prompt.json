  { "name": "name", "label": "Trigger + filename base (typed as you'll use it; ':' optional; becomes <name>.yml)", "default": ":example", "multiline": false },

  "template": [
    "Objective",
  "Create exactly one espanso command from two inputs — (1) name={{name}} and (2) description={{description}} — optimized for intuitive use and aligned with this repository’s structure.",
    "",
    "Context",
  "You are generating a snippet that will be installed under 'espanso-package/match/'. Prior templates sometimes copied text verbatim; you must instead interpret intent and improve the command. The consuming app expects a single-paragraph output artifact (one physical line).",
    "",
    "Inputs",
  "- name: the trigger to use directly (we'll normalize minimally; see below).",
    "- description: plain-language goal of the command.",
    "",
    "Constraints",
    "- Output MUST be exactly one paragraph (one physical line), no line breaks or blank lines.",
    "- Do not include commentary, headings, or analysis in the final output.",
    "- Avoid secrets, destructive shell actions, and unsafe vars.",
    "- Use repository conventions for lint/tests/sync.",
    "",
    "Instructions",
  "- Think critically: interpret description, do not copy literally; normalize and improve phrasing for usability.",
  "- Trigger: use {{name}} as provided with light normalization only: trim spaces; if it does not start with ':', prefix a single ':'; preserve dots/hyphens; avoid adding ':pa.' unless explicitly part of {{name}}; lowercase unless case is essential.",
  "- Trigger collisions: avoid obvious collisions with existing triggers (:th, :comms, :bias, :nra, :tf) by appending a short numeric suffix (e.g., '-1') only if an exact match to one of these.",
  "- Target file: always create a NEW file under 'espanso-package/match/'. Name it from {{name}} with normalization: strip leading ':', trim, lowercase, replace spaces with '-', remove characters outside [a-z0-9._-], and append '.yml'.",
  "  - Collision handling: if a file with that name already exists in match/, append a short numeric suffix (e.g., '-1.yml'). DO NOT append to existing files.",
  "- Replacement style: infer from description and emulate canonical patterns without changing the file naming: bias/truth/falsify/steelman/evidence→write a comprehensive adversarial analysis in the spirit of bias.yml (single-line); continuity/context/next steps/resume/session link→write a continuity loop prompt like nra.yml (single-line, include the 'Action: <summary> :' tail); simple thinking prompt→concise thinking aid like tf.yml; otherwise produce a succinct practical instruction. Add only minimal safe vars when they add obvious value (e.g., today's date, clipboard).",
  "- YAML: produce ONE-PARAGRAPH flow-style of a full espanso YAML with vars nested inside the match, e.g., matches:[{trigger:\":example\",replace:\"Your text here\",vars:[{name:\"today\",type:\"date\",params:{format:\"%Y-%m-%d\"}}]}]. Escape quotes/backslashes; encode intended newlines as literal \\n.",
    "- Repo commands: lint with 'scripts/espanso.sh lint'; tests 'pytest -q tests/espanso'; sync 'scripts/espanso.sh sync'.",
    "- Ambiguity: when minor, choose the safest common interpretation and proceed; avoid speculative features.",
    "",
    "Execution Flow",
  "1) Restate the intent internally; 2) Design trigger and derive a new target_file name; 3) Draft replacement and optional vars (style from heuristics); 4) Render single-paragraph YAML snippet; 5) Assemble single-paragraph JSON payload with fixed keys.",
    "",
  "Output Format (MANDATORY — one physical line)",
  "Return ONLY a minified single-paragraph JSON object with exactly these keys and order, no extras: {\"name\":<string>,\"trigger\":<string>,\"target_file\":<string>,\"snippet_yaml\":<string>} — where target_file is a new filename like '<normalized-name>.yml' and snippet_yaml is the one-line YAML from the previous step.",
    "",
    "Quality Checks (run silently, do not emit)",
  "- JSON parseable; keys present and ordered; snippet YAML is one paragraph; trigger conforms; target_file is new (would not append to an existing file); no unsafe commands; placeholders used.",
    "",
    "Self-Check (silent)",
    "- Did I avoid verbatim copying? Is the output exactly one physical line? Are repo conventions followed?"
